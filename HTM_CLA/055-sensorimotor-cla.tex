\chapter{Temporal Pooling and the new Sensorimotor CLA}
\label{chapter:sensorimotor-cla}

This chapter describes the new theory of Temporal Pooling with Sensorimotor
Learning and Behaviour. Chapters~\ref{chapter:learning} through
\ref{chapter:transition-memory} described how a single-layer region recognises
sensory patterns and learns variable-order sequences.
